<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<section class="doc-section">
<h3 id="1-1-english-not-legalese">1.1 English, Not Legalese</h3>
<p>Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.</p>
<p>We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible. Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.</p>
<p>When you read ‘the matrix.org homeserver’ or ‘the Service’ below, it refers to the services made available at <strong>matrix.org</strong> which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>
<p>Where you read <em>New Vector</em>, <em>New Vector Ltd.</em> or <em>we <em>or</em> us</em> below, it refers to the company we created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support Matrix’s development and so run the matrix.org homeserver: New Vector Ltd., and its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents. <strong>This agreement does not apply to Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (matrix.org) provided by New Vector Ltd.</strong></p>
<p>If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else!</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service in any way, whether you have created a Matrix account on the matrix.org homeserver, or whether you are accessing content federated from the matrix.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver, or are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from accessing content federated from this server.</p>

<h3 id="1-3-this-is-a-living-document">1.3 This Is a Living Document</h3>
<p>This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.</p>
<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears! Email support@matrix.org and we’ll chat.</p>
<p>We don’t amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we’ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.</p>
<p>We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.</p>
<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.</p>

<h3 id="1-4-breach-of-terms">1.4 Breach of Terms</h3>
<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Service automatically terminates.</p>
<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.</p>

<h2 id="2-support">2. Support</h2>
<p>Support for the matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by New Vector Ltd - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms (as listed in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+matrix:matrix.org">+matrix:matrix.org</a> community).</p>
<p>Queries sent to <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">support@matrix.org</a> will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the paid team. Phone support is not provided.</p>
<p>We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we’ll try our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.</p>

<p>We do not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or files uploaded to the Service.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that we have no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your messages or files modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute them, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.</p>
<p>We may pre-screen user messages or files to prevent spam and other abuse, and we may remove any messages or files (including entire rooms) from the matrix.org homeserver for any reason without notice at our sole discretion. By posting or uploading your messages or files, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you to post or upload said messages or files.</p>
<p>You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your messages and files that you post or otherwise submit via the Service.

<p>In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability of the Service and your data.</p>
<p>We monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email, push notifications and phone calls) when the matrix.org homeserver is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that New Vector Ltd. shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on the matrix.org homeserver at any time.</p>

<h2 id="5-app-developers">5. App Developers</h2>
<p>We encourage you to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces with the Service!</p>
<p>The Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time, and we may change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the Service from time to time - it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to or via our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service. We will always try to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice so you can adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.</p>
<p>Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement and our policies and procedures, you may use the Service to execute Applications owned by you. You are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images or content they contain.</p>

<p><strong>A note to other startups:</strong> this document was heavily inspired by <a href="https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/">Balsamiq’s plain English ToS document</a>. We were impressed by their championing of plain English, and wanted to reproduce that as much as possible in our own legal documentation. Feel free to draw similar inspiration from this document, though be sure to get any documents you produce checked over by a lawyer. Good luck!</p>
